# Summary of Behavior Patterns

### Encapsulating Variation

The patterns usually define an abstract class that describes the encapsulating object, and the pattern derives its name from that object.

* A _**Strategy**_ object encapsulates an algorithm
* A _**State**_ object encapsulates a state-dependent behavior
* A _**Mediator**_ object encapsulates the protocol between objects
* An _**Iterator**_ object encapsulates the way you access and traverse the components   of an aggregate object.

But not all object behavioral patterns partition functionality like this. _**Chain of Responsibility**_ illustrates another difference in behavioral patterns. it prescribes communication between an open-ended number of objects.
