# Bridge \(Handle/Body\)

## Introduction: {#introduction}

Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

## Motivation & When should use builder pattern {#motivation-and-when-should-use-builder-pattern}

* ​You want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation.
* _**\(if the implementation need to be switched at run-time\)**_ Both the abstractions and implementations should be extensible by subclassing.
* Changes in the implementation of an abstraction should have no impact on clients.
* Hide the implementation of an abstraction completely from clients.
* You want to share an implementation among multiple objects.
