# Abstract Factory Pattern

## Introduction:

Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

{% hint style="info" %}
Clients are not aware of the concrete class they are using, they only get the abstract interface from the factory.
{% endhint %}
