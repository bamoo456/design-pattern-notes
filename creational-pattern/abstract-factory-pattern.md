# Abstract Factory Pattern

## Introduction:

Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

{% hint style="info" %}
Abstract factory is for creating abstract interface, not concrete class.
{% endhint %}



### Motivation & When should use builder pattern {#motivation-and-when-should-use-builder-pattern}

* Clients don't know what is the concrete class they used from the **Abstract Factory.**
* A system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.
* A family of related product objects is designed to be used together, and you need to enforce this constraint. **\(that is, you want to make the system logics only run with couple of abstract interface\)**
* If you want to provide a class library of products, and you want to just reveal just their interfaces. **\(not implementations\)**
