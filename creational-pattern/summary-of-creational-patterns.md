# Summary of Creational Patterns

## Summary:

#### Creational Patterns are not exclusive:

#### Many factors decide which pattern should be adapted

#### Often, designs start out using Factory Method and evolve toward the other creational patterns as the designer discovers where more flexibility is needed.



## Pattern Template

#### Factory Method:

The basic and most simple pattern for creating objects

```go
package main

// usually with below patterns
type factory struct {}

func (f factory) NewProductA() {}

func (f factory) NewProductB() {}

func (f factory) NewProductC() {}

func main() {
}
```

#### Abstract Factory:

```text

```

#### Builder:

```text

```

#### Prototype:

```text

```
