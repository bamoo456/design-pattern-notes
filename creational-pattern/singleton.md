# Singleton

## Introduction:

Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

## Motivation & When should use builder pattern

* Some class can only has exactly one instance. \(e.g. Only one _filesystem_ in the _OS_\)
* For this single instance, it must be accessible to clients from a well-known access point.
* When the sole instance should be extensible by subclassing, and clients should be able to use an extended instance _without modifying their code._

### Singleton:

defines an Instance operation that lets clients access its unique instance. 

> Different language may have different way to implement the **Singleton Pattern**

## Code Example - Golang

**NOTE**:
{% endhint %}
